## Introduction
This project a 'BigInteger' class in C++ that allows for handling very large integers beyond the limits of built-in data types like 'init' or 'long long'. The project was developed as a learning exercise and has functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and various comparision of large integers.

## Concepts Learned 
Working on this project allowed me to explore several key concepts in C++:
- **Operator Overloading**: To handle arithmetic operations ('+','-','*',etc.) with 'BigInteger' objects.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of dynamic memory, especially with large number storage and operations.
- **Class Design**: Structuring classes with constructors, destructors, and member functions.
- **String Manipulation**: Converting numbers to strings and managing string operations to simulate large integer calculations.
- **Data Structures**: Using arrays or vectors to represent the digits of large integers.
- **Algorithms for Large Integer Arithmetic**: Understanding and implementing algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparisons on large integers.
- **Error Handling**: Managing edge cases like negative numbers and zero values effectively.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Ensuring that operations function correctly under various conditions and inputs.

## Features
- Supports large integer arithmetic for numbers of arbitrary length.
- Implements operator overloading for `+`, `-`, `*`, and comparison operators (`==`, `<`, `>`, etc.).
- Efficient memory management to handle large calculations.
- Error handling for edge cases such as zero and negative values.
